"""
Parallel system smoke test for the Keisei Shogi training system.
Tests that parallel environment collection can initialize and run without deadlocking.

Note: This test will be expanded once the parallel system is actually implemented.
For now, it serves as a placeholder and tests the potential for parallel execution.
