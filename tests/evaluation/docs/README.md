## üìÅ Documentation Consolidation (June 14, 2025)

### Recent Changes - Documentation Cleanup
This documentation directory has been consolidated to eliminate duplication and improve organization. The following files were moved from `tests/evaluation/` to `tests/evaluation/docs/`:

#### Files Consolidated:
- ‚úÖ **EVAL_TESTS.md** - Moved from root evaluation folder (420 lines)
- ‚úÖ **PHASE1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md** - Moved from root evaluation folder (160 lines)  
- ‚úÖ **PHASE2_READINESS.md** - Moved from root evaluation folder (122 lines)
- ‚úÖ **EVAL_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md** - Updated with latest version (Phase 2 completion status)

#### Eliminated Duplicates:
- üóëÔ∏è Removed duplicate `EVAL_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md` from root (outdated version)
- üóëÔ∏è Cleaned up scattered markdown files from evaluation root directory
- üìã Updated all cross-references to point to docs folder

#### Benefits:
- **Single Source of Truth**: All documentation now centralized in `/docs/` folder
- **No Duplication**: Eliminated conflicting versions of the same documents  
- **Clear Navigation**: Updated README.md provides comprehensive index
- **Historical Preservation**: All previous documentation preserved with proper context
