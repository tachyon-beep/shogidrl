"""
Comprehensive performance validation tests for the evaluation system.

These tests validate the key performance claims and optimization features:
1. 10x speedup from in-memory evaluation vs file-based
2. Memory usage optimization and limits
3. Cache performance and LRU eviction efficiency
4. Background processing performance
5. Scalability characteristics
6. GPU memory efficiency (when available)
