# Updated Test Remediation Plan for Keisei Shogi Implementation

## Executive Summary

This updated remediation plan tracks progress on addressing the significant test coverage gaps and issues in the Shogi module tests. We've successfully completed Phase 1 by implementing a mocking solution for PyTorch dependencies that allows tests to run without initialization errors. The overall test coverage is still at 10%, with most of the code in `shogi_game.py` (1% coverage) and `shogi_game_io.py` (3% coverage) not being properly tested, but we now have a reliable foundation for expanding test coverage.

## Current Status

### 1. Completed Tasks (Phase 1)
- ✅ Created a mock utilities module (`tests/mock_utilities.py`) that provides mock implementations of PyTorch-dependent classes
- ✅ Implemented a patch for the `_add_docstr` function to resolve the PyTorch initialization error: `RuntimeError: function '_has_torch_function' already has a docstring`
- ✅ Created a context manager function `setup_pytorch_mock_environment()` that allows tests to run without PyTorch initialization errors
- ✅ Demonstrated the mock approach with two working test files:
  - `test_shogi_with_mocks_example.py`: Shows the pattern for mocking PyTorch dependencies
  - `test_shogi_game_mocked.py`: Uses the same pattern to test actual game functionality

### 2. Current Issues Remaining
- Overall test coverage: 10%
- `shogi_core_definitions.py`: 49% coverage
- `shogi_game.py`: 1% coverage (423 out of 423 statements untested)
- `shogi_game_io.py`: 3% coverage (149 out of 154 statements untested)
- Test quality issues (e.g., faulty test in `test_undo_move_multiple_moves`)
- Duplicated tests across multiple files

## Updated Remediation Plan

### Phase 2: Core Game Logic Coverage (High Priority, In Progress)

**Tasks:**
1. Use the mock utility pattern to create comprehensive tests for `shogi_game.py`:
   - Convert existing `test_shogi_game.py` tests to use the mock pattern
   - Implement tests for game initialization with different SFEN strings
   - Add tests for move execution (all move types including promotions and drops)
   - Cover game state transitions (player turns, move counting)
   - Test win conditions (checkmate, resignation)
   - Verify draw conditions (repetition)

2. Create parametrized tests for different game scenarios:
   - Middle game positions
   - Endgame positions
   - Special rule edge cases

**Expected Outcome:** Increase coverage of `shogi_game.py` from 1% to at least 70%.

### Phase 3: Game I/O Coverage (Medium Priority)

**Tasks:**
1. Apply the mock pattern to test `shogi_game_io.py`:
   - Create tests for text representation (board, pieces, player info)
   - Test SFEN string generation with different board states
   - Verify neural network observation generation for various game states
   - Test KIF file generation

2. Add specific tests for the text formatting changes made during the recent enhancement phases:
   - Column label spacing in board display
   - Player turn information formatting
   - Error message formatting for SFEN validation

**Expected Outcome:** Increase coverage of `shogi_game_io.py` from 3% to at least 70%.

### Phase 4: Neural Network Integration Testing (Medium Priority)

**Tasks:**
1. Expand the observation plane constants test:
   - Test with different game states (not just initial position)
   - Test with pieces in hand
   - Test with promoted pieces
   - Test with different player turns

2. Write tests to ensure policy and value outputs are correctly computed from observations:
   - Test policy mask generation
   - Test policy/value head output shapes
   - Test handling of terminal states

**Expected Outcome:** Comprehensive testing of the neural network integration, especially around game state observation generation.

### Phase 5: Test Consolidation and Cleanup (Low Priority)

**Tasks:**
1. Consolidate duplicated undo move tests:
   - Refactor `test_make_undo_move.py` and `test_shogi_game.py` to use a common test fixture
   - Ensure all undo scenarios are covered exactly once
   - Fix the specific issue in `test_undo_move_multiple_moves`

2. Remove or implement the commented-out tests in `test_shogi_rules_logic.py`:
   - Delete the observation plane tests that are now handled by `test_observation_constants.py`
   - Delete the undo move tests that are now handled by other test files

3. Implement missing tests for Phase 1-5 enhancements:
   - Text formatting alignment
   - SFEN validation error messages
   - Undo logic state restoration verification
   - Uchi-Fu-Zume recursion guard documentation

**Expected Outcome:** Clean, non-redundant test suite with clear separation of concerns.

## Test Coverage Targets (Unchanged)

| Module                      | Current | Target |
|-----------------------------|---------|--------|
| shogi/__init__.py           | 67%     | 90%    |
| shogi_core_definitions.py   | 49%     | 80%    |
| shogi_game.py               | 1%      | 70%    |
| shogi_game_io.py            | 3%      | 70%    |
| OVERALL                     | 10%     | 75%    |

## Conclusion

Phase 1 of the remediation plan is now complete with a working solution for testing modules that depend on PyTorch. With this foundation in place, we can now move forward with expanding test coverage across the codebase. The next steps focus on implementing comprehensive tests for core game logic and game I/O capabilities using our established mock pattern.
