   - Integration points with 9-manager architecture mapped
   - Performance and event-driven patterns analyzed

2. **✅ WebUI Module Architecture**: Complete architecture design created
   - Manager pattern consistency maintained with WebUIManager
   - Real-time WebSocket data streaming architecture
   - React-based component system mirroring Rich components
   - Production-ready performance and security considerations
   - Progressive migration strategy with dual operation support

3. **✅ Architecture Documentation**: Comprehensive 15-section documentation
   - High-level architecture and integration patterns
   - Detailed component design and API specifications
   - Technology stack with rationale and implementation phases
   - Performance requirements and security considerations
   - Complete deployment architecture and migration planning

4. **✅ Architecture Certificate**: Formal approval with conditions
   - Architecture approved for implementation
   - Performance validation and security review required
   - Migration testing and documentation completeness mandated

### Architecture Decision Rationale

The WebUI architecture preserves Keisei's proven manager-based architecture while enabling modern web monitoring:

- **WebUIManager** integrates as 10th manager following established patterns
- **Dual Operation Mode** enables Rich console and WebUI simultaneously during migration
- **Event-Driven Updates** preserve non-blocking training performance
- **Component Mirroring** ensures feature parity between Rich and web interfaces
- **Progressive Migration** minimizes risks and preserves existing workflows

### Next Required Actions

1. **Coordinate Peer Reviews**: Request specialized agent reviews
2. **Validate Architecture Decisions**: Ensure all aspects properly reviewed
3. **Document Review Outcomes**: Consolidate feedback and recommendations
4. **Provide Implementation Guidance**: Support transition to implementation phase
