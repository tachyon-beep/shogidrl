## AI Coder Tasking Statement: Codebase Refinements

This document outlines three key tasks to improve the stability, maintainability, and future-readiness of the Keisei Shogi RL codebase. Please address each task systematically, following the detailed instructions provided.

### Task 1: Fix Worker Model Decompression Logic

**Goal**: Ensure that `SelfPlayWorker` correctly decompress_contentes model weights received from the `WorkerCommunicator` if they were sent in a compressed format.

**Background**:
The `WorkerCommunicator._prepare_model_data` method compresses model tensors using `gzip` and includes a `compressed: True` flag along with metadata (`shape`, `dtype`) for each tensor when sending model updates. The `SelfPlayWorker._update_model` method currently accesses `data_item["data"]` but does not check the `compressed` flag or perform decompression, which will lead to errors if compression is active.

**File to Modify**: `keisei/training/parallel/self_play_worker.py`

**Method to Modify**: `SelfPlayWorker._update_model(self, model_data: Dict)`

**Detailed Steps**:

1.  **Access Decompression Utilities**:
    * The `keisei/training/parallel/model_sync.py` file contains a `ModelSynchronizer._decompress_array(self, compressed_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> np.ndarray` method. This method correctly handles decompression of data prepared by `ModelSynchronizer._compress_array`.
    * **Option A (Preferred)**: Refactor `_decompress_array` (and its dependency `_compress_array`, if not already done for consistency in data format) into a shared utility function within `keisei/training/parallel/utils.py` (create this file if it doesn't exist) or directly into `keisei/training/parallel/communication.py` if it's deemed more appropriate as `WorkerCommunicator` is preparing the data. This utility should take the compressed bytes, shape, and dtype, and return the decompressed NumPy array.
    * **Option B**: Replicate the logic of `ModelSynchronizer._decompress_array` directly within `SelfPlayWorker._update_model` or as a private helper method within `SelfPlayWorker`.

2.  **Modify `_update_model` Logic**:
    * Inside the loop `for key, data_item in weights.items():`, where `data_item` is the dictionary containing potentially compressed tensor data (e.g., `{'data': compressed_bytes, 'shape': ..., 'dtype': ..., 'compressed': True}`).
    * Before attempting `torch.from_numpy(data_item["data"])`, check if `data_item.get("compressed", False)` is `True`.
    * **If `compressed` is `True`**:
        * Extract `compressed_bytes = data_item["data"]`.
        * Extract `shape = data_item["shape"]`.
        * Extract `dtype_str = data_item["dtype"]`. Convert this string to a `np.dtype` object (e.g., `dtype = np.dtype(dtype_str)`).
        * Call the decompression utility (from Step 1) with `compressed_bytes`, `shape`, and `dtype`. This should return the decompressed `np.ndarray`.
        * The line `state_dict[key] = torch.from_numpy(data_item["data"])` should be changed to `state_dict[key] = torch.from_numpy(decompressed_np_array)`.
    * **If `compressed` is `False` (or the flag is missing)**:
        * The existing logic `state_dict[key] = torch.from_numpy(data_item["data"])` can be used, assuming `data_item["data"]` is already an uncompressed `np.ndarray`. Ensure `data_item["data"]` is indeed a NumPy array in this case, not raw bytes. The current implementation of `WorkerCommunicator._prepare_model_data` stores `np_array` directly if not compressing.

    **Example Snippet (Conceptual)**:
    ```python
    # Inside SelfPlayWorker._update_model
    # ...
    for key, data_item in weights.items():
        if isinstance(data_item, dict) and "data" in data_item:
            np_array_data: np.ndarray
            if data_item.get("compressed", False):
                # Assuming decompress_worker_data is the utility function/method
                # It would internally use gzip.decompress, np.frombuffer, and reshape
                np_array_data = decompress_worker_data(
                    data_item["data"],  # compressed bytes
                    data_item["shape"],
                    data_item["dtype"]
                )
            else:
                np_array_data = data_item["data"] # Should be np.ndarray if not compressed

            state_dict[key] = torch.from_numpy(np_array_data).to(self.device) # Ensure tensor is on worker's device
        else:
            # Handle older format or direct numpy array if necessary (as per existing code)
            state_dict[key] = torch.from_numpy(data_item).to(self.device)
    # ...
    ```

3.  **Ensure Correct Device**: After `torch.from_numpy()`, ensure the tensor is moved to `self.device` if not already handled by the decompression utility (e.g., `torch.from_numpy(decompressed_np_array).to(self.device)`).

4.  **Testing Considerations**:
    * Add or update tests to specifically verify the model synchronization path with `compression_enabled: True` in `ParallelConfig`.
    * Tests should confirm that a model compressed by `WorkerCommunicator` can be successfully received, decompressed, and loaded by `SelfPlayWorker`, resulting in identical model parameters to the source.

### Task 2: Refactor `constants.py` and Consolidate Configuration Defaults

**Goal**: Eliminate redundancy between `constants.py` and `AppConfig` default values, making `AppConfig` the single source of truth for configurable defaults. Clean up `constants.py` to only hold true, non-configurable constants.

**Files to Modify**:
* `keisei/constants.py`
* `keisei/config_schema.py` (specifically `AppConfig` and its sub-models)
* Any files in the codebase that use the constants being refactored.

**Detailed Steps**:

1.  **Audit and Cleanup `constants.py`**:
    * **Remove Internal Duplicates**: Go through `keisei/constants.py` and remove all exact duplicate constant definitions (e.g., `DEFAULT_RENDER_EVERY_STEPS` defined twice, `TEST_BUFFER_SIZE` defined twice). Resolve any value conflicts by choosing the correct one or the one predominantly used.
    * **Identify Configurable Defaults**: Create a list of all constants in `constants.py` that start with "DEFAULT\_" (e.g., `DEFAULT_LEARNING_RATE`, `DEFAULT_GAMMA`, `DEFAULT_TOWER_DEPTH`). For each, check if a corresponding configuration parameter exists in `keisei/config_schema.py` (e.g., `TrainingConfig.learning_rate`, `TrainingConfig.gamma`).

2.  **Consolidate Defaults into `AppConfig`**:
    * For every "DEFAULT\_" constant identified in Step 1 that corresponds to an `AppConfig` parameter:
        * Ensure the default value in `AppConfig`'s `Field(default=...)` is set to the value from the `constants.py` file. For example, if `constants.py` has `DEFAULT_LEARNING_RATE = 3e-4`, then `TrainingConfig` in `config_schema.py` should have `learning_rate: float = Field(3e-4, ...)`.
        * Once the default is confirmed/set in `AppConfig`, **delete** the "DEFAULT\_" constant definition from `keisei/constants.py`.
    * The goal is that `AppConfig` itself defines all default values for its fields.

3.  **Update Codebase Usage**:
    * Perform a global search in the codebase for usages of the "DEFAULT\_" constants that were removed from `constants.py`.
    * **Scenario A (Accessing a Default)**: If a removed constant was used to get a default value that is now part of the runtime `config` object, change the code to access it from the `config` object.
        * Example:
            ```python
            # OLD (assuming DEFAULT_LEARNING_RATE was used somewhere)
            # lr = constants.DEFAULT_LEARNING_RATE

            # NEW (if 'lr' should be the configured learning rate)
            # lr = trainer.config.training.learning_rate
            ```
    * **Scenario B (Test Setups)**: If a removed "DEFAULT\_" constant was used in tests to define a configuration for a test model or scenario:
        * Tests should now instantiate the relevant `AppConfig` sub-model (or the full `AppConfig`) using its Pydantic defaults.
        * Alternatively, if a test specifically needs to override a default, it should do so by providing that value when creating the test `AppConfig` instance.
    * **Scenario C (Direct Usage of Default Value Logic)**: In rare cases, if the default was used in some logic path explicitly *because it was the default*, ensure this logic now correctly refers to the config object's attribute.

4.  **Final State of `constants.py`**:
    * After refactoring, `keisei/constants.py` should only contain:
        * **True immutable constants**: Values that are fundamental to the application and not meant to be configured (e.g., `SHOGI_BOARD_SIZE = 9`, mathematical constants like `EPSILON_SMALL`).
        * **Named literals/keys**: String keys for dictionaries, event names, etc., if these are fixed and used in multiple places (e.g., `OBS_CURRENT_PLAYER_UNPROMOTED_START = 0`).
        * **Test-specific, non-configurable constants**: Values used exclusively in tests that don't represent default configurations of the main application (e.g., `TEST_PARAMETER_FILL_VALUE`, `TEST_MAX_DEPENDENCY_ISSUES`).

5.  **Testing Considerations**:
    * Run all existing tests to ensure that the default behavior of the application remains unchanged.
    * Pay close attention to tests that might have relied on the old constants for setting up configurations.
    * Verify that loading a minimal configuration file (or no config file) results in the application using the defaults now defined within `AppConfig`.

### Task 3: Plan Pydantic v1 to v2 Migration

**Goal**: Outline the steps and considerations for migrating the Pydantic models (primarily `AppConfig` in `keisei/config_schema.py`) from Pydantic V1 to V2.

**Background**: The current codebase uses Pydantic V1 features. Pydantic V2 offers significant performance improvements and an updated API. This task is to *plan* the migration; the actual migration might be a subsequent task.

**Detailed Plan Steps**:

1.  **Preparation and Research**:
    * **Official Documentation**: Thoroughly review the official Pydantic V2 Migration Guide.
    * **Identify V1 Usage**: Scan the codebase (especially `keisei/config_schema.py`) for Pydantic V1 specific patterns:
        * `Config` class within models.
        * Usage of `@validator`.
        * Model methods like `.dict()`, `.json()`, `.parse_obj()`, `.parse_raw()`.
        * Field definitions and type hinting styles that might have changed.

2.  **Environment Setup for Migration**:
    * Create a new branch for the migration.
    * Update the Pydantic library version in the project's dependency management file (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) to the latest Pydantic V2 version.
    * Re-create the virtual environment and install the updated dependencies.

3.  **Automated Migration (Optional but Recommended First Pass)**:
    * Investigate and consider using the `bump-pydantic` tool. This is a codemod that can automate many of the V1 to V2 changes.
    * If used, run `bump-pydantic` on the codebase. Carefully review all changes made by the tool.

4.  **Manual Code Changes (Focus on `config_schema.py`)**:
    * **`Config` Class**: Convert nested `class Config:` to `model_config: SettingsDict = {...}` (or `model_config = {}` if using the new style).
        * Example: `extra = "forbid"` becomes `{"extra": "forbid"}` within the `model_config` dictionary.
    * **Model Methods**:
        * Replace `.dict(...)` with `.model_dump(...)`. Note changes in arguments (e.g., `exclude_none` behavior).
        * Replace `.json(...)` with `.model_dump_json(...)`. (The codebase already uses `model_dump_json` in `training/utils.py::serialize_config`, which is good).
    * **Validators**:
        * Convert `@validator(...)` decorators to `@field_validator(...)` for field-specific validation.
        * Convert model-level validators (`@root_validator`) to `@model_validator(...)`.
        * Update validator function signatures. The `values` dictionary in V1 root validators is handled differently with `mode='before'` or `mode='after'` model validators in V2.
    * **Data Parsing/Validation**:
        * Replace `MyModel.parse_obj(data_dict)` with `MyModel.model_validate(data_dict)`.
        * Replace `MyModel.parse_raw(json_string)` with `MyModel.model_validate_json(json_string)`.
    * **Type Hinting and Fields**: Review all field definitions for compatibility. V2 has stricter type checking and improved handling of `Optional`, defaults, and computed fields.
    * **Aliases**: If field aliases are used, ensure they are correctly handled with `Field(validation_alias=...)` or `Field(serialization_alias=...)` as needed.

5.  **Update Codebase Usage of Pydantic Models**:
    * Search for all places where `AppConfig` or its sub-models are instantiated or their methods (`.dict()`, etc.) are called.
    * Update these call sites according to the V2 API changes (e.g., `config.dict()` to `config.model_dump()`). This will primarily affect how the config object is used for logging, saving, or passing to W&B.

6.  **Testing Strategy for Migration**:
    * **Initial Run**: After updating the library (and optionally running `bump-pydantic`), run the entire test suite. This will highlight many immediate breaking changes.
    * **Iterative Fixes**: Address test failures systematically, focusing on one type of Pydantic change at a time (e.g., all `Config` classes, then all `.dict()` calls).
    * **Validation Logic**: Pay special attention to tests covering custom validators, as their logic and signatures will change. Ensure validation behavior remains identical.
    * **Serialization/Deserialization Tests**: Verify that configurations can still be loaded from files (if applicable) and serialized to JSON with the same structure and content as before (or an intentionally changed, correct structure).
    * **Default Value Tests**: Confirm that models instantiated without overriding arguments still receive the correct default values.

7.  **Documentation and Review**:
    * Document any significant changes or decisions made during the migration.
    * Conduct a thorough code review of all migrated Pydantic models and their usage.

**Considerations for the AI Coder**:
* The migration should be performed on a separate branch.
* Prioritize getting `keisei/config_schema.py` fully V2 compliant first.
* Lean heavily on the official Pydantic V2 migration guide as the primary source of truth.
* Commit changes frequently with clear messages describing the type of V1-V2 conversion being applied.
