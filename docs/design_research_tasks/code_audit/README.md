# Code Audit Documentation

This directory contains materials related to a code audit performed on the Keisei project. The primary goal of the audit was to analyze the codebase for its architecture, maintainability, and to identify strategic action plans for improvement.

## Audit Process

The audit was conducted using "Deep Research" capabilities, leveraging a GitHub plugin integration with ChatGPT. This allowed for an AI-assisted analysis of the codebase.

## Contents

This directory includes:

*   **`__Shogidrl (DRL Shogi Client) Code Audit Report__.pdf`**: The comprehensive code audit report. This document details the findings, focusing on:
    *   Codebase architecture
    *   Maintainability aspects
    *   Strategic recommendations and action plans
*   **`__Under the Hood of AI_ Decoding a Shogi Master's Code Secrets__.mp3`**: An audio transcription of the audit report. This transcription was generated by Gemini.
    *   *Note: The transcription was unexpectedly formatted as a podcast-style audio file, which is preserved here for its novelty.*
*   **`code_audit_prompt.md`**: The prompt used to initiate the code audit with the AI tools.

This information provides insights into the state of the codebase at the time of the audit and offers a baseline for future development and refactoring efforts.
