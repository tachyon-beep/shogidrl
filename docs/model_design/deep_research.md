Here is a comparative analysis of the three proposed neural network architectures for the Shogi Deep Reinforcement Learning model. The document describes each proposal in written form and presents a side-by-side comparison in a table, highlighting their key differences without expressing a preference.

### **Comparative Overview of Proposed Shogi DRL Architectures**
This document outlines three distinct neural network architectures for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent designed to play Shogi. The proposals are labeled G, O, and D. Each offers a significant upgrade in complexity and representational power over a simple, single-layer convolutional model.

---

### **Written Descriptions**
**Proposal G: AlphaZero-Inspired Residual Network**
This architecture is modeled closely on the successful AlphaZero framework. It begins with a comprehensive and high-dimensional input representation of the game state, using 250-360 feature planes. This input tensor details piece positions over a history of 8 moves, the pieces held in hand by each player, and global game state indicators like repetition counts.

The core of the network is a deep body consisting of an initial convolutional layer (256 filters) followed by a stack of 19 residual blocks. Each block contains two convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activations, with a skip connection that aids in training the deep network.

The body's output is then processed by two distinct heads:

* **Policy Head:** This head is designed to handle Shogi's complex action space in a spatially intuitive way. It uses a convolutional layer to produce a `9x9x139` tensor of logits. This structure directly maps potential moves, including drops, to each square on the board before being flattened into a final action vector.

* **Value Head:** This head uses a convolutional layer, followed by a flattening operation and two fully-connected layers, to produce a single scalar value (`v`) between -1 and 1, representing the estimated outcome of the game.

The design philosophy emphasizes a very detailed input representation and a proven deep network structure to learn hierarchical features effectively.

**Proposal O: Residual-Tower Actor-Critic with Squeeze-and-Excite**

This architecture uses a shared "Residual-Tower" as a powerful feature extractor. It accepts an input tensor of 46–77 planes and processes it with an initial "stem" convolutional layer that expands the channel count to 256 while preserving the `9x9` board shape.

The main body is a tower of 20 identical residual blocks. A key feature of these blocks is the inclusion of a **Squeeze-and-Excite** module. This module performs channel-wise feature recalibration by globally pooling features, passing them through a small bottleneck layer, and using the result to scale the importance of each of the 256 feature maps. This allows the network to dynamically emphasize more informative features.

The tower then feeds into two small, efficient heads that maintain spatial information as long as possible:

* **Policy Head:** A `1x1` convolutional layer first reduces the feature maps to 2 channels. This `2x9x9` tensor is then flattened, and a single linear layer maps the resulting 162 features to the final 13,527-action space.

* **Value Head:** A `1x1` convolutional layer collapses the 256 feature maps to a single plane. This `1x9x9` tensor is flattened to 81 features, which are then passed through two linear layers to produce the final scalar value.

The design focuses on computational efficiency, deep feature extraction with dynamic channel-wise attention (Squeeze-and-Excite), and sharing the bulk of the network between the policy and value functions.

**Proposal D: Transformer-Based Architecture**

This proposal represents a different architectural paradigm, moving away from purely convolutional networks to leverage self-attention mechanisms, as seen in state-of-the-art models for other complex games. The architecture treats the Shogi board not as an image, but as a sequence of 81 tokens (one for each square).

Each of the 81 tokens is converted into a rich vector embedding that encodes information about the piece at that square (including its history), positional information, and relevant game state data. Information about pieces in hand is typically incorporated via special global tokens added to this sequence.

The core of the network is a stack of **Transformer encoder layers**. Each layer uses a multi-head self-attention mechanism, which allows every board position (token) to directly weigh the influence of and gather context from every other position on the board. This makes the architecture exceptionally well-suited for capturing long-range dependencies and global interactions, which are critical in Shogi.

The output sequence from the Transformer body is used by the two heads:

* **Policy Head:** Processes the output token embeddings, often using linear layers to predict move likelihoods associated with each token (e.g., moves *from* a square, or drops *onto* a square).

* **Value Head:** Aggregates information across all output tokens—for instance, by using the embedding of a special classification token or an attention-based pooling mechanism—and passes it through a small network to produce the final scalar value.

The primary design philosophy is to model the game state as a set of interacting objects, allowing for more direct and flexible modeling of global board relationships than is possible with the fixed receptive fields of CNNs.
