### 1. Overview üìú

* **Purpose of this Folder/Module Set:**
  Implements the core evaluation loop that orchestrates multi-game tournaments between trained PPO agents and various opponents. This module handles the game-by-game execution, result tracking, and statistical computation for agent performance assessment.

* **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Execute multiple game matches between agent and opponent
  - Handle alternating player roles and legal move validation
  - Track game outcomes (wins, losses, draws) and statistics
  - Compute win rates, game lengths, and performance metrics
  - Integrate with logging systems for detailed evaluation tracking
  - Support different opponent types (PPO agents, heuristic players, random players)

* **Domain Context:**
  Multi-game evaluation framework for Shogi reinforcement learning agents, providing tournament-style assessment with statistical analysis of agent performance against various baselines and opponents.

* **High-Level Architecture / Interaction Summary:**
  The evaluation loop serves as the execution engine for agent assessment, receiving configured agents and opponents from the evaluation orchestrator and running systematic game matches. It interfaces with the Shogi game engine for rule enforcement and move validation, while providing structured results to logging and analysis systems.

## Notes for AI/Agent Developers üß†

1. **Player Alternation:** The loop correctly handles Shogi player alternation with agent as Sente (Black) and opponent as Gote (White)
2. **Legal Move Validation:** All moves are validated against legal move sets before execution to prevent invalid game states
3. **Statistical Accuracy:** Results computation handles edge cases like zero games played and maintains floating-point precision
4. **Extensibility:** The opponent interface allows easy integration of new opponent types without modifying the core loop
