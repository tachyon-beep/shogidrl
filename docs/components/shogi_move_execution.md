### 1. Overview üìú

* **Purpose of this Folder/Module Set:**
  Handles the execution and application of moves in the Shogi game engine, including board state updates, capture processing, promotion handling, and game termination detection. Provides the core move execution logic that maintains game state consistency.

* **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Execute validated moves on the game board
  - Process piece captures and add captured pieces to hands
  - Handle piece promotion during move execution
  - Update game state (current player, move count)
  - Detect game termination conditions (checkmate, stalemate, repetition)
  - Maintain move history and board state tracking

* **Domain Context:**
  Core move execution engine for Japanese Chess (Shogi), ensuring rule compliance and state consistency during gameplay while supporting both human play and AI training scenarios.

* **High-Level Architecture / Interaction Summary:**
  
  * Acts as the move execution engine called by ShogiGame.make_move()
  * Integrates with shogi_rules_logic for validation and termination detection
  * Maintains strict separation between move validation and execution
  * Supports simulation mode for AI lookahead without permanent state changes

  * **Usage Examples:**
    ```python
    # Executed internally by ShogiGame.make_move()
    # Execute a board move
    move = (6, 4, 5, 4, False)  # Pawn forward
    success = game.make_move(move)  # Calls apply_move_to_board internally
    
    # Execute a drop move
    drop = (None, None, 4, 4, PieceType.PAWN)
    success = game.make_move(drop)
    ```
