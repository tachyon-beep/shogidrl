---

### 8. Performance Considerations ⚡

#### Setup Overhead:
- One-time setup cost at training start
- Component creation may involve significant computation
- Checkpoint loading time proportional to model size

#### Memory Management:
- Multiple components created and held simultaneously
- Experience buffer allocation based on configuration
- Model device transfer during setup

#### Optimization Strategies:
- Minimize debug logging in production
- Efficient component creation order
- Early validation to fail fast on errors

---

### 9. Security Considerations 🔒

#### Component Security:
- All setup operations run with full system privileges
- No validation of component initialization integrity
- Checkpoint loading trusts external files

#### File System Security:
- Log file creation and writing without access controls
- Checkpoint file access without validation
- No sanitization of logged information

#### Configuration Security:
- Configuration values used directly without validation
- Device specification trusted without verification
- No isolation between setup components

#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Validate configuration parameters before use
- Implement access controls for sensitive operations
- Add integrity checking for loaded checkpoints
- Sanitize logged information to prevent information disclosure

### 10. Error Handling 🚨

#### Setup Failures:
- Component creation failures raise RuntimeError with context
- Rich console display for user-friendly error messages
- Fatal errors prevent training from continuing

#### Checkpoint Errors:
- Checkpoint resume failures handled gracefully
- Training can continue from scratch if resume fails
- Detailed error logging for debugging

#### Logging Errors:
- File I/O errors during logging don't stop setup
- Fallback to stderr for critical error messages
- Graceful degradation for logging failures

#### Recovery Strategies:
- Clear error messages for user action
- Fallback to default initialization when possible
- Comprehensive logging for post-mortem analysis

### 11. Configuration ⚙️

#### Required Configuration:
```python
config.training.steps_per_epoch: int      # Experience buffer size
