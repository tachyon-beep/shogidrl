## 2. Detailed Findings
### 2.1 Test Catalogue

#### CKPT_001 — `test_load_checkpoint_with_padding_scenarios`
* **Objective:** Test checkpoint loading with different channel padding scenarios (parameterised)
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** Good use of parameterization, focused test
* **Suggested Action:** Consider adding edge case tests (zero channels, negative values)
* **Priority:** Low

## 3. Summary & Next Steps

**Top Three Refactor Targets:**

1. **Test Coverage**: Add edge case tests for invalid inputs and error conditions.

2. **Test Expansion**: Add tests for other checkpoint functionality beyond channel padding.

3. **Documentation**: Consider adding more descriptive test scenarios for complex padding logic.

**Overall Assessment:** This is a well-designed, focused test module that demonstrates good use of parameterization. The test is concise and clearly tests the intended functionality. This serves as a good example of focused unit testing.
