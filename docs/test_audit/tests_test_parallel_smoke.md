## 2. Detailed Findings
### 2.1 Test Catalogue

#### PSMOKE_001 — `TestParallelSmoke::test_basic_multiprocessing_functionality`
* **Objective:** Test basic multiprocessing functionality with worker processes
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** Minor Flaw
* **Key issues:** Hardcoded sleep delays (0.01s), potential timing-dependent failures
* **Suggested Action:** Use more deterministic synchronization methods
* **Priority:** Medium

#### PSMOKE_002 — `TestParallelSmoke::test_parallel_environment_collection_placeholder`
* **Objective:** Placeholder for future parallel environment collection tests
* **Status:** Placeholder
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** Potentially Pointless
* **Key issues:** Empty test body with only pass statement
* **Suggested Action:** Implement actual test or remove placeholder
* **Priority:** Low

#### PSMOKE_003 — `TestParallelSmoke::test_config_compatibility_with_parallel`
* **Objective:** Test that config system works with potential parallel settings
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** None
* **Suggested Action:** Keep as-is
* **Priority:** Low

## 3. Summary & Next Steps

**Top Three Refactor Targets:**

1. **PSMOKE_002**: Remove placeholder test or implement actual parallel collection testing once the parallel system is developed.

2. **PSMOKE_001**: Replace sleep-based timing with proper synchronization primitives to eliminate potential race conditions.

3. **Test Coverage**: Expand parallel testing once the actual parallel system is implemented, focusing on deadlock detection and resource contention.

**Overall Assessment:** This test module serves as a foundation for future parallel system testing but currently provides limited value due to placeholder status and timing-dependent test design.
