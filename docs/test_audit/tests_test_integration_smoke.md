## 2. Detailed Findings
### 2.1 Test Catalogue

#### SMOKE_001 — `TestIntegrationSmoke::test_training_smoke_test`
* **Objective:** Run a very short training session to ensure the system can initialize
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** Minor Flaw
* **Key issues:** Incomplete test - only tests initialization, not actual training execution; complex mock setup; hardcoded values
* **Suggested Action:** Either complete the training test or rename to reflect initialization-only testing
* **Priority:** Medium

#### SMOKE_002 — `TestIntegrationSmoke::test_evaluation_smoke_test`
* **Objective:** Test that evaluation components can be imported and basic classes work
* **Status:** Partially Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** Potentially Pointless
* **Key issues:** Only tests imports and basic object creation, no actual functionality
* **Suggested Action:** Expand to test basic evaluation functionality or remove if redundant with import tests
* **Priority:** Medium

#### SMOKE_003 — `TestIntegrationSmoke::test_config_system_smoke_test`
* **Objective:** Test that the configuration system works correctly
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** Hardcoded values in assertions (0.001), magic numbers
* **Suggested Action:** Use relative comparisons or config-derived values
* **Priority:** Low

## 3. Summary & Next Steps

**Top Three Refactor Targets:**

1. **SMOKE_001**: Complete the training test by actually running training loop or rename to reflect initialization-only scope. The current implementation creates false confidence about training pipeline health.

2. **SMOKE_002**: Either expand to test actual evaluation functionality or merge with other import tests to avoid redundant checking.

3. **Test Coverage**: Add meaningful integration tests that exercise inter-component communication rather than just basic instantiation.

**Overall Assessment:** This smoke test module provides basic sanity checking but falls short of meaningful integration testing. The tests primarily verify imports and initialization rather than system behaviour under actual execution conditions.
