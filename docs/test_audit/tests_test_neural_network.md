## 2. Detailed Findings
### 2.1 Test Catalogue

#### NN_001 — `test_actor_critic_init_and_forward`
* **Objective:** Test ActorCritic initializes and forward pass works with dummy input
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** Major Flaw
* **Key issues:** Massive hardcoded config creation instead of using fixtures; magic numbers (13527, 46); duplicated config values
* **Suggested Action:** Use config fixtures and parameterized tests for different input sizes
* **Priority:** High

## 3. Summary & Next Steps

**Top Three Refactor Targets:**

1. **NN_001**: Replace massive config creation with proper fixtures and focus test on neural network functionality rather than config management.

2. **Test Coverage**: Add tests for different model architectures, edge cases, and error conditions.

3. **Parameterization**: Add parameterized tests for different input dimensions and batch sizes.

**Overall Assessment:** This test module provides minimal coverage with a heavily flawed test design that conflates config testing with neural network testing. Requires significant refactoring for maintainability.
