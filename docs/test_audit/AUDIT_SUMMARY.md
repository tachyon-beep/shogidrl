   - **Issue:** Massive inline config creation and duplication across tests
   - **Impact:** Maintenance nightmare, test brittleness, poor readability
   - **Remediation:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Extracted config creation into reusable fixtures in `conftest.py`

2. **Broken Tests** ✅ **FIXED** (Files: `test_trainer_session_integration.py`, `test_training_loop_manager.py`)
   - **Issue:** Tests that reference undefined fixtures or contain no functional testing
   - **Impact:** False test coverage, potential CI failures
   - **Remediation:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fixed fixture references and implemented real functionality testing

3. **Extreme Over-Mocking in Integration Tests** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (File: `test_trainer_training_loop_integration.py`)
   - **Issue:** Integration tests that mock 10+ components, testing mocks rather than integration
   - **Impact:** Tests don't validate real component interactions
   - **Remediation:** 🔄 **PARTIALLY COMPLETED** - Reduced mocking to essential external dependencies only

4. **Monolithic Test Files** 📋 **PLANNED** (File: `test_shogi_game_core_logic.py`)
   - **Issue:** 1411-line test file testing multiple concerns
   - **Impact:** Difficult debugging, poor maintainability, slow test execution
   - **Remediation:** 📋 **PHASE 2** - Split into focused modules (observation, moves, SFEN, rules)

### 🟡 Medium-Priority Issues

1. **Manual State Manipulation** (Files: `test_shogi_game_rewards.py`, `test_reward_with_flipped_perspective.py`, `test_shogi_game_mock_comprehensive.py`)
   - **Issue:** Tests manually set game_over, winner, termination_reason instead of using proper game moves
   - **Impact:** Tests don't validate real game logic, brittle state management
   - **Remediation:** Use proper game move sequences to reach desired states

2. **Context Manager Misuse** (File: `test_shogi_game_io.py`)
   - **Issue:** Setup context managers exit before test operations
   - **Impact:** Incorrect test environment, potential false positives
   - **Remediation:** Fix context manager scope

3. **Timing-Dependent Tests** (Files: `test_profiling.py`, `test_parallel_smoke.py`, `test_remediation_integration.py`)
   - **Issue:** Sleep-based timing and artificial delays create brittle tests
   - **Impact:** Unreliable CI/CD, platform-dependent failures
   - **Remediation:** Mock time module or use deterministic testing

4. **Protected Member Access** (Files: Multiple)
   - **Issue:** Direct manipulation of protected attributes for testing
   - **Impact:** Tests coupled to implementation details
   - **Remediation:** Use public APIs or provide test-specific methods

5. **Placeholder Tests** (Files: `test_parallel_smoke.py`, `test_training_loop_manager.py`)
   - **Issue:** Empty test functions with only `pass` statements or no functionality
   - **Impact:** False test coverage, maintenance overhead
   - **Remediation:** Implement or remove placeholders

6. **Platform Dependencies** (File: `test_profiling.py`)
   - **Issue:** Memory tracking and performance tests may behave differently across platforms
   - **Impact:** Inconsistent test results
