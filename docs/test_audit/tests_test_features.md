* **Objective:** Test feature channel organization and validation
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** Good coverage of channel mapping logic
* **Suggested Action:** Keep as-is
* **Priority:** Low

#### FEAT_011-015 — Integration Tests
* **Objective:** Test feature extraction integration with game engine
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** Minor Flaw
* **Key issues:** Some tests may overlap with game engine tests
* **Suggested Action:** Ensure clear separation of concerns
* **Priority:** Medium

## 3. Summary & Next Steps

**Top Three Refactor Targets:**

1. **Test Separation**: Ensure feature tests focus on feature extraction logic rather than game engine functionality.

2. **Parameterization**: Consider parameterized tests for different feature configurations.

3. **Performance**: Add performance tests for feature extraction on large game states.

**Overall Assessment:** This test module provides solid coverage of feature extraction functionality with generally well-designed tests. Minor improvements needed in test focus and separation of concerns.
