## 2. Detailed Findings
### 2.1 Test Catalogue

#### EXP_001-004 — Buffer Operations Tests
* **Objective:** Test basic experience buffer operations (add, get, clear)
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** Well-focused tests on buffer mechanics
* **Suggested Action:** Keep as-is
* **Priority:** Low

#### EXP_005-008 — Buffer Capacity Tests
* **Objective:** Test buffer capacity management and overflow handling
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** Good edge case coverage
* **Suggested Action:** Keep as-is
* **Priority:** Low

#### EXP_009-012 — GAE and Advantage Tests
* **Objective:** Test Generalized Advantage Estimation calculations
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** Minor Flaw
* **Key issues:** Complex mathematical calculations may need more comprehensive edge case testing
* **Suggested Action:** Add more edge cases for GAE calculations
* **Priority:** Medium

## 3. Summary & Next Steps

**Top Three Refactor Targets:**

1. **Mathematical Edge Cases**: Add more comprehensive edge case testing for GAE and advantage calculations.

2. **Performance Testing**: Add performance tests for large buffer operations.

3. **Memory Management**: Test memory usage patterns with large experience buffers.

**Overall Assessment:** This test module provides good coverage of experience buffer functionality with well-structured tests. The GAE testing could be more comprehensive for mathematical edge cases.
