## 2. Detailed Findings
### 2.1 Test Catalogue

**Note:** This is a comprehensive 1411-line test file covering core Shogi game logic. Below is a representative sample of key tests.

#### SGCL_001 — `test_get_observation_initial_state_dimensions`
* **Objective:** Test observation tensor has correct dimensions for initial game state
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** None
* **Suggested Action:** Keep as-is
* **Priority:** Low

#### SGCL_002-005 — Hand Piece Observation Tests
* **Objective:** Test observation tensor correctly represents pieces in hand for both players
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** None
* **Suggested Action:** Keep as-is
* **Priority:** Low

#### SGCL_006-007 — Current Player Plane Tests
* **Objective:** Test observation correctly indicates whose turn it is
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** None
* **Suggested Action:** Keep as-is
* **Priority:** Low

#### SGCL_008-015 — Move Undo Tests
* **Objective:** Test comprehensive move undo functionality including captures, drops, promotions
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** Minor Flaw
* **Key issues:** Complex setup code repeated across tests, potential for test interdependence
* **Suggested Action:** Extract common setup into fixtures
* **Priority:** Medium

#### SGCL_016-020 — SFEN Tests
* **Objective:** Test SFEN (Shogi Forsyth-Edwards Notation) serialization/deserialization
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** Hardcoded SFEN strings
* **Suggested Action:** Use parameterized tests for multiple SFEN scenarios
* **Priority:** Low

#### SGCL_021-030 — Game State Tests
* **Objective:** Test game state management, board representation, and move validation
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** Some tests are quite long and test multiple concepts
* **Suggested Action:** Consider splitting complex tests into focused units
* **Priority:** Medium

#### SGCL_031-044 — Advanced Rule Tests
* **Objective:** Test complex Shogi rules including promotion zones, check detection, etc.
* **Status:** Fully Implemented
* **Pointless / Flawed / Duplicate:** None
* **Key issues:** High complexity in individual tests
* **Suggested Action:** Consider extracting helper methods for rule validation
* **Priority:** Medium

## 3. Summary & Next Steps

**Top Three Refactor Targets:**

1. **Test Organization**: This 1411-line file should be split into multiple focused test modules (observation tests, move tests, SFEN tests, rule tests) for better maintainability.

2. **Setup Duplication**: Many tests repeat similar game setup code. Extract common patterns into fixtures or helper methods to reduce duplication and improve reliability.

3. **Test Complexity**: Some individual tests are very long and test multiple concepts. Consider breaking complex tests into smaller, focused units that test single behaviours.

**Overall Assessment:** This test module provides excellent comprehensive coverage of the Shogi game engine but suffers from monolithic structure and setup duplication. The tests themselves are well-written and thorough, but the organization makes maintenance and debugging more difficult than necessary. This is a high-value refactoring target due to the criticality of the game engine to the overall system.
