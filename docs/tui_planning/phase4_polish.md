# Phase 4 â€“ Polish and Documentation

The final stage focuses on user configurability, cleanup and comprehensive documentation.

## Goals

1. Allow users to enable or disable each feature via configuration.
2. Provide examples and reference material in the repository docs.
3. Benchmark performance to confirm negligible overhead.

## Tasks

### 1. Configuration Wiring
- Ensure `DisplayConfig` values can be loaded from YAML and overridden via CLI if applicable.
- Update `default_config.yaml` with a new `display` section showing commented defaults.
- Document each option in `docs/README.md` or a new quick reference page.

### 2. Documentation and Examples
- Capture screenshots or ASCII examples demonstrating the enhanced dashboard.
- Update `HOW_TO_USE.md` with instructions for enabling the features.
- Provide example config files in `examples/` illustrating typical setups.

### 3. Performance Verification
- Use the profiling utilities (`utils/profiling.py`) to measure frame rendering time with and without enhancements.
- Record results in a short report inside `docs/tui_planning/performance_notes.md`.

## Testing Notes

- Run the full test suite with enhancements enabled to guard against regressions.
- Ensure headless environments (e.g., CI) do not fail when Rich cannot create a console; use the fallback layout there.
