# TUI Enhancement Implementation Plan

This folder contains step-by-step planning documents for implementing the advanced training display features outlined in `docs/TUI_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md`.  Each phase corresponds to a milestone in the development cycle.  The tasks here provide specific guidance for the AI assistant or developer responsible for coding the new functionality.

## Document List

- `phase1_infrastructure.md` – Setup of display component framework and configuration.
- `phase2_core_features.md` – Implementation of board display, trend sparklines and Elo rating system.
- `phase3_layout.md` – Construction of the multi-panel dashboard and adaptive layout management.
- `phase4_polish.md` – Final integration, documentation and performance checks.

Review the tasks within each phase in order.  The plan assumes familiarity with the architecture described in `docs/1. DESIGN.md` and file locations documented in `docs/2. CODE_MAP.md`.
