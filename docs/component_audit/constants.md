### 1. Overview ðŸ“œ

* **Purpose of this Module:**
  Centralizes numerical constants and static values used throughout the application. By defining them in one place the codebase avoids magic numbers and maintains consistency between modules.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Provide board and action space constants for the Shogi environment
  - Define observation channel indices and normalization factors
  - Serve as a shared reference for other modules

### 2. Dependencies ðŸ”—

None

## Notes for AI/Agent Developers ðŸ§ 

Update these constants carefully as downstream modules may rely on them for tensor shapes and normalization logic.
