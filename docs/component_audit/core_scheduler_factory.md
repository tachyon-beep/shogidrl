### 1. Overview ðŸ“œ

* **Purpose of this Module:**
  Factory helper for creating PyTorch learning rate schedulers used in PPO training. Provides a single entry point for selecting scheduler strategies such as cosine annealing or exponential decay.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Create and configure LR scheduler instances based on configuration
  - Hide conditional logic for scheduler selection from training loops

### 2. Dependencies ðŸ”—

* **External:** `torch.optim.lr_scheduler`
* **Internal:** none

## Notes for AI/Agent Developers ðŸ§ 

Extend this factory when adding new learning rate schedule types so they can be configured without modifying training code.
