### 1. Overview ðŸ“œ

* **Purpose of this Module:**
  Handles efficient synchronization of model weights between the main training process and worker processes. Supports optional gzip compression and version tracking.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Serialize and compress model parameters for transmission
  - Apply received weights to worker models safely

### 2. Dependencies ðŸ”—

* **Internal:** `.utils` for compression helpers
* **External:** `torch`, `numpy`, `gzip`
