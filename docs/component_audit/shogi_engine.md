# Shogi Engine Module Documentation

## Module Overview

**File:** `keisei/shogi/shogi_engine.py`

**Purpose:** Provides backward compatibility layer for legacy code by re-exporting core Shogi components from the refactored module structure.

**Core Functionality:**
- Re-exports fundamental Shogi types and classes
- Maintains API compatibility for existing imports
- Simplifies migration from old module structure to new refactored components

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- `shogi_core_definitions`: Core enums and data structures (Color, MoveTuple, Piece, PieceType)
- `shogi_game`: Main game implementation (ShogiGame)

### External Dependencies
None

## Class Documentation

This module contains no class definitions - it only provides re-exports for backward compatibility.

## Module-Level Components

### Exported Symbols

**`__all__`**
- **Type:** List[str]
- **Value:** `["Color", "PieceType", "Piece", "ShogiGame", "MoveTuple"]`
- **Purpose:** Explicitly defines the public API exported by this module

### Re-exported Components

**`Color`**
- **Source:** `shogi_core_definitions.Color`
- **Type:** Enum
- **Purpose:** Represents player colors (BLACK, WHITE)

**`PieceType`**
- **Source:** `shogi_core_definitions.PieceType`
- **Type:** Enum
- **Purpose:** Represents all Shogi piece types including promoted variants

**`Piece`**
- **Source:** `shogi_core_definitions.Piece`
- **Type:** Class
- **Purpose:** Represents a Shogi piece with type and color

**`ShogiGame`**
- **Source:** `shogi_game.ShogiGame`
- **Type:** Class
- **Purpose:** Main game state and logic implementation

**`MoveTuple`**
- **Source:** `shogi_core_definitions.MoveTuple`
- **Type:** NamedTuple
- **Purpose:** Structured representation of Shogi moves

## Data Structures

This module defines no new data structures - it only re-exports existing ones.

## Inter-Module Relationships

### Dependencies
```
shogi_engine
    ├── shogi_core_definitions (imports core types)
    └── shogi_game (imports main game class)
```

### Usage Patterns
```python
# Legacy import pattern (still supported)
from keisei.shogi.shogi_engine import ShogiGame, Color, PieceType

# New import pattern (preferred)
from keisei.shogi import ShogiGame, Color, PieceType
```

## Implementation Notes

### Design Patterns
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to the refactored module structure
- **Re-export Pattern**: Maintains backward compatibility without code duplication

### Architecture Considerations
- **Minimal Module**: Contains only import statements and `__all__` declaration
- **Compatibility Layer**: Allows gradual migration to new module structure
- **No Implementation**: All functionality is provided by imported modules

### Migration Strategy
The module supports a two-phase migration:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Legacy code continues to work with `shogi_engine` imports
2. **Phase 2 (Future)**: Migrate to direct imports from specific modules

```python
# Legacy (supported)
from keisei.shogi.shogi_engine import ShogiGame

# Migrated (preferred)
from keisei.shogi.shogi_game import ShogiGame
# or
from keisei.shogi import ShogiGame
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Import Testing**: Verify all re-exported symbols are accessible
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure legacy import patterns continue to work
- **Symbol Validation**: Confirm re-exported objects match their sources

### Test Cases
```python
def test_backward_compatibility():
    """Test that legacy imports still work."""
    from keisei.shogi.shogi_engine import ShogiGame, Color, PieceType
    
    # Verify classes are importable and functional
    game = ShogiGame()
    assert Color.BLACK is not None
    assert PieceType.KING is not None

def test_re_export_consistency():
    """Test that re-exported symbols match originals."""
    from keisei.shogi.shogi_engine import ShogiGame as LegacyGame
    from keisei.shogi.shogi_game import ShogiGame as DirectGame
    
    assert LegacyGame is DirectGame
```

### Integration Testing
- **Legacy Code Compatibility**: Test existing codebases that use old imports
- **Cross-Module Consistency**: Verify re-exported classes behave identically to direct imports

## Performance Considerations

### Runtime Impact
- **Minimal Overhead**: Re-exports add negligible import time
- **Memory Efficiency**: No duplication of classes or data
- **Import Chain**: Adds one level of indirection to import resolution

### Optimization Notes
- Module is lightweight with no computational overhead
- Import statements are resolved at module load time
- No runtime performance impact after import

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Public API Only**: Only exports symbols intended for external use
- **No Internal Exposure**: Does not expose internal implementation details

### Validation
- **Import Safety**: All re-exported symbols are from trusted internal modules
- **No External Dependencies**: Reduces security surface area

## Error Handling

### Import Errors
```python
# If source modules are unavailable, import will fail clearly
try:
    from keisei.shogi.shogi_engine import ShogiGame
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"Failed to import ShogiGame: {e}")
```

### Error Propagation
- Import errors from source modules are propagated unchanged
- No additional error handling needed in this compatibility layer

## Configuration

This module requires no configuration - it simply re-exports existing components.

## Future Enhancements

### Deprecation Strategy
1. **Documentation Updates**: Mark legacy imports as deprecated
2. **Warning Messages**: Add deprecation warnings for old import patterns
3. **Migration Tools**: Provide automated tools to update import statements
4. **Removal Timeline**: Plan eventual removal of this compatibility layer

### Implementation
```python
import warnings

def __getattr__(name):
    """Provide deprecation warnings for legacy imports."""
    if name in __all__:
        warnings.warn(
            f"Importing {name} from shogi_engine is deprecated. "
            f"Use 'from keisei.shogi import {name}' instead.",
            DeprecationWarning,
            stacklevel=2
        )
        # Return the appropriate symbol...
```

### Migration Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Current compatibility layer (indefinite)
- **Phase 2**: Add deprecation warnings (future version)
- **Phase 3**: Remove compatibility layer (major version bump)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Legacy import (still supported)
from keisei.shogi.shogi_engine import ShogiGame, Color

# Create game instance
game = ShogiGame()
current_player = Color.BLACK
```

### Migration Example
```python
# Before (legacy)
from keisei.shogi.shogi_engine import ShogiGame, Color, PieceType

# After (preferred)
from keisei.shogi import ShogiGame, Color, PieceType
# or
from keisei.shogi.shogi_game import ShogiGame
from keisei.shogi.shogi_core_definitions import Color, PieceType
```

## Maintenance Notes

### Code Reviews
- Verify that re-exports remain in sync with source modules
- Check that `__all__` list matches actual exports
- Ensure no new functionality is added to this compatibility layer

### Monitoring
- Track usage of legacy imports vs. direct imports
- Monitor for any issues with the compatibility layer
- Plan migration timeline based on usage metrics

### Documentation
- Keep this documentation updated with source module changes
- Maintain clear migration guidance for users
- Document any breaking changes in the compatibility layer
