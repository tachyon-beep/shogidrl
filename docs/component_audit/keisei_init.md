### 1. Overview ðŸ“œ

* **Purpose of this Module:**
  Provides the package initialization for the top level `keisei` package. It re-exports commonly used classes such as `ShogiGame` and evaluation utilities so that users can import them directly from `keisei`.
* **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Define the public API of the package through `__all__`
  - Re-export central types and helpers from submodules
  - Simplify user imports for evaluation entry points

### 2. Dependencies ðŸ”—

* **Internal:**
  - `keisei.shogi.shogi_core_definitions`
  - `keisei.shogi.shogi_game`
  - `keisei.evaluation.evaluate`
* **External:** None

## Notes for AI/Agent Developers ðŸ§ 

The package `__init__` keeps the import surface small and friendly. When extending the project, update `__all__` here to expose new high-level utilities.
