## REVIEW SCOPE
- Current training display system architecture analysis
- Rich-based TUI infrastructure assessment
- Neural architecture visualization opportunities identification
- Advanced metrics and learning dynamics analysis
- Tournament evaluation system enhancement potential
- Performance monitoring integration possibilities

## FINDINGS

### Current System Strengths
- **Rich Console Infrastructure**: Sophisticated terminal-based graphics with adaptive layouts
- **Manager-Based Architecture**: Clean separation allowing seamless component integration
- **Comprehensive Data Collection**: Extensive metrics tracking (1000+ data points)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Configurable refresh rates with performance optimization
- **Multi-Panel Dashboard**: Board visualization, sparklines, evolution tracking

### Neural Architecture Visualization Opportunities  
- **SE-Block Attention Extraction**: ResNet SE attention can be extracted and visualized in real-time
- **Policy/Value Head Divergence**: Separate visualization of "what to do" vs "how good is this"
- **Feature Activation Patterns**: Hierarchical pattern recognition at different network depths
- **Weight Evolution Tracking**: Current system tracks statistics but lacks temporal visualization

### Learning Dynamics Enhancement Potential
- **Learning Phase Detection**: Algorithm can classify Exploration/Discovery/Refinement/Convergence phases
- **Breakthrough Moment Identification**: KL divergence spikes indicate strategy discoveries
- **Multi-Metric Correlation Analysis**: Reveal causal relationships in training dynamics
- **Strategy Emergence Timeline**: Track when different tactical capabilities develop

### Performance Monitoring Gaps Identified
- **torch.compile Impact**: No visualization of optimization benefits (despite infrastructure existing)
- **Resource Utilization**: Missing GPU/CPU memory usage and garbage collection patterns
- **Training Pipeline Bottlenecks**: Limited visibility into actual performance constraints
- **Distributed Training**: No coordination visualization for multi-GPU setups

### Tournament System Enhancement Opportunities
- **ELO Trajectory Visualization**: Historical rating progression vs current snapshots
- **Playstyle Analysis Matrix**: Performance patterns against different opponent types
- **Adversarial Evolution Tracking**: Arms race dynamics in self-play development
- **Strategy Counter-Development**: Timeline of strategic adaptation patterns

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: RECOMMEND
**Rationale**: Keisei's training system has exceptional foundation infrastructure with Rich console capabilities and comprehensive data collection. The existing manager-based architecture provides perfect integration points for advanced visualizations. The neural architecture (ResNet with SE blocks) offers excellent opportunities for attention visualization and internal state monitoring. The tournament evaluation system provides rich data for strategy evolution analysis.

**Conditions**: Implementation should proceed in phases to maintain real-time performance requirements while adding increasingly sophisticated visualizations.
