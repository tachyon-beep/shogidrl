### Interactive Elements Recommended
1. **"Pause and Predict"**: Chat participation in move prediction
2. **Parameter Adjustment**: Live hyperparameter modification demonstrations
3. **Historical Replay**: Breakthrough learning moment playback system
4. **Strategy Polls**: Viewer voting on training strategies/openings

## DECISION/OUTCOME
**Status**: RECOMMEND
**Rationale**: Comprehensive analysis identifies high-impact visualization opportunities that balance entertainment value with educational depth. The Keisei system provides excellent algorithmic transparency through its manager-based architecture and comprehensive metric collection.

**Conditions**: 
- Primary dashboard should focus on SE attention heatmaps and PPO metrics for broad appeal
- Technical deep-dives should be toggle-able to avoid overwhelming casual viewers  
- Interactive elements require careful chat integration to maintain educational focus
- Real-time data extraction may require additional instrumentation in training loop
