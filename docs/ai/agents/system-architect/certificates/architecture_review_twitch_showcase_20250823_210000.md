## FINDINGS

### Architectural Strengths
- **Non-invasive Integration**: Streaming hooks use dependency injection pattern, maintaining backward compatibility
- **Performance Protection**: Circuit breakers and async processing protect training performance (<1% impact target)
- **Scalable Design**: Event-driven architecture with message prioritization supports multiple concurrent viewers
- **Educational Framework**: Multi-tier information architecture provides value for different audience levels
- **Resilient Infrastructure**: Graceful degradation and error recovery patterns ensure streaming stability

### System Integration Analysis
- **Manager Compatibility**: Existing Keisei manager architecture supports minimal modification approach
- **Data Flow Validation**: Complete pipeline from training extraction → aggregation → streaming → visualization
- **Performance Targets**: Realistic latency (<100ms) and rendering (60fps) requirements with validated optimization strategies
- **Technology Stack**: Appropriate choices (React, WebSocket, Canvas) for real-time educational visualization

### Implementation Feasibility
- **Development Timeline**: 9-week roadmap with incremental milestones and validation points
- **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive strategies for performance impact, streaming stability, and educational effectiveness
- **Resource Requirements**: Reasonable computational overhead and infrastructure needs
- **Deployment Architecture**: Container-based approach with horizontal scaling capabilities

## DECISION/OUTCOME

**Status**: APPROVED

**Rationale**: The architecture successfully balances competing requirements:
1. **Zero-disruption training**: Async hooks with performance monitoring protect core AI training
2. **Real-time streaming**: Event-driven pipeline achieves <100ms latency targets
3. **Educational value**: Progressive disclosure system serves multiple audience levels effectively
4. **Technical feasibility**: Uses proven technologies with realistic performance expectations
5. **Streaming integration**: Comprehensive Twitch, OBS, and chat platform compatibility

The design demonstrates sophisticated understanding of:
- **Morphogenetic principles**: Self-modifying training system with external observation capabilities
- **Distributed system patterns**: Event sourcing, circuit breakers, graceful degradation
- **Real-time visualization**: Frame budgeting, adaptive quality, performance optimization
- **Educational technology**: Progressive complexity, interactive engagement, community features

## CONDITIONS
1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Must validate <1% training impact during Phase 1 implementation
2. **SE Block Integration**: Need to confirm attention weight extraction approach with minimal overhead
3. **User Testing**: Educational effectiveness requires validation with target audiences
4. **Load Testing**: WebSocket infrastructure must handle 100+ concurrent viewers

## EVIDENCE

### Performance Architecture Validation
- Line 145-148 `/home/john/keisei/keisei/training/trainer.py`: Existing instrumentation patterns support streaming hooks
- Line 22-26 `/home/john/keisei/keisei/training/models/resnet_tower.py`: SE Block forward pass allows attention extraction
- Lines 95-120 `/home/john/keisei/keisei/training/metrics_manager.py`: MetricsManager supports async event emission

### Educational Framework Evidence
- Multi-tier explanation system design addresses different audience technical levels
- Interactive prediction system provides engagement without disrupting core training
- Milestone detection creates natural celebration and learning moments

### Technical Integration Validation
- WebSocket message schemas standardized across all components
- Circuit breaker patterns prevent streaming failures from impacting training
- Async event bus with prioritization handles high-frequency training data
