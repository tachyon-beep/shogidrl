Model Architecture Refactoring Summary (June 2, 2025)

This document summarizes the refactoring of Actor-Critic model implementations
to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created BaseActorCriticModel
- **File**: `keisei/core/base_actor_critic.py`
- **Purpose**: Shared base class implementing common ActorCritic methods
- **Inherits**: `nn.Module`, `ActorCriticProtocol` (via ABC)
- **Provides**: 
  - `get_action_and_value()` - Common action sampling logic with legal mask support
  - `evaluate_actions()` - Common action evaluation logic
  - Proper NaN handling and warning messages
  - Value tensor squeezing logic

### 2. Refactored ActorCritic
- **File**: `keisei/core/neural_network.py`
- **Change**: Now inherits from `BaseActorCriticModel` instead of `nn.Module`
- **Removed**: Duplicated `get_action_and_value` and `evaluate_actions` methods (~60 lines)
- **Retained**: Model-specific `__init__` and `forward` methods

### 3. Refactored ActorCriticResTower
- **File**: `keisei/training/models/resnet_tower.py`
- **Change**: Now inherits from `BaseActorCriticModel` instead of `nn.Module`
- **Removed**: Duplicated `get_action_and_value` and `evaluate_actions` methods (~60 lines)
- **Retained**: Model-specific architecture (ResNet blocks, SE blocks, etc.)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated ~120 lines of duplicated code
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Bug fixes and improvements in shared methods now apply to all models
3. **Enhanced Consistency**: Both models now use identical action selection and evaluation logic
4. **Better Error Reporting**: Warning messages now include the specific model class name
5. **Future-Proof**: New ActorCritic models can easily inherit shared functionality

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing APIs remain unchanged
- All existing tests continue to pass
- No changes to model serialization/deserialization
- PPOAgent continues to work with both model types without modification

## Testing

- Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_actor_critic_refactoring.py`
- Verified that both models inherit from `BaseActorCriticModel`
- Confirmed identical behavior for shared methods
- Validated deterministic mode functionality
- All existing model-specific tests continue to pass

## Future Considerations

- New ActorCritic model implementations should inherit from `BaseActorCriticModel`
- Model-specific logic should be implemented only in `forward()` and `__init__()`
- Consider extracting additional common patterns if more models are added
