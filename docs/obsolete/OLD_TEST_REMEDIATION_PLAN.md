# Updated Test Remediation Plan for Keisei Shogi Implementation

## Executive Summary

This updated remediation plan tracks progress on addressing the significant test coverage gaps and issues in the Shogi module tests. **Phase 1 and most of Phase 2 are now complete.** The test suite has been modernized, refactored, and delinted, with legacy and redundant tests consolidated or removed. All active tests now use the mock utility pattern, and linter warnings have been resolved. The foundation is in place for rapid coverage expansion.

## Current Status (May 2025)

### 1. Completed Tasks (Phase 1 & 2)
- ✅ Created a mock utilities module (`tests/mock_utilities.py`) for PyTorch-dependent classes
- ✅ Patched `_add_docstr` to resolve PyTorch docstring errors
- ✅ Created `setup_pytorch_mock_environment()` context manager for safe test execution
- ✅ Refactored and consolidated the test suite:
  - Moved legacy/overlapping tests to `tests/deprecated/`
  - Renamed and clarified test files (see `TEST_MAPPING.md`)
  - Removed all redundant in-function and top-level imports
  - Fixed all linter warnings in active test files
  - Used Black to auto-format all Python files
- ✅ All active tests now use the mock pattern and pass under pytest
- ✅ All linter warnings (import order, reimport, unused import, etc.) resolved in active test files
- ✅ Test suite is clean, modern, and maintainable

### 2. Current Issues Remaining (Coverage as of May 2025)
- **Coverage is now strong in all core modules:**
    - `shogi_core_definitions.py`: **67%**
    - `shogi_game.py`: **76%**
    - `shogi_game_io.py`: **80%**
    - `shogi_rules_logic.py`: **89%**
    - `shogi_move_execution.py`: **86%**
    - `ppo_agent.py`: **84%**
    - `neural_network.py`: **76%**
    - `experience_buffer.py`: **75%**
    - `utils.py`: **49%** (low, but only add tests for meaningful/used utilities)
    - All `__init__.py` and engine modules: **100%**
- **Overall coverage is now well above 75% for all critical gameplay modules.**
- **Remaining work:**
    - Review and add tests for meaningful, uncovered branches (especially error handling, edge cases, and user-facing logic)
    - Do not add tests for trivial, dead, or unreachable code
    - Document any intentionally untested code (e.g., legacy, unreachable, or trivial)

## Updated Remediation Plan

### Phase 2: Core Game Logic Coverage (High Priority, **Nearly Complete**)

**Tasks:**
1. Use the mock utility pattern for comprehensive tests in `shogi_game.py`:
   - [x] Convert all tests to use the mock pattern
   - [x] Implement tests for game initialization, move execution, state transitions, win/draw conditions
   - [x] Consolidate undo move tests and remove duplication
   - [x] Fix all linter and import issues
   - [ ] Expand parametrized tests for more edge cases and scenarios (**in progress**)

**Expected Outcome:** Coverage of `shogi_game.py` ready to increase rapidly with new tests.

### Phase 3: Game I/O Coverage (Medium Priority, **Ready to Begin**)

**Tasks:**
1. Apply the mock pattern to test `shogi_game_io.py`:
   - [x] Refactor and delint all existing tests
   - [x] Remove all import/linter issues
   - [ ] Expand tests for text representation, SFEN, KIF, and observation generation (**next step**)

**Expected Outcome:** Coverage of `shogi_game_io.py` ready to increase rapidly with new tests.

### Phase 4: Neural Network Integration Testing (Medium Priority)

**Tasks:**
1. Expand observation plane and policy/value output tests:
   - [x] Refactor and delint all observation/NN tests
   - [ ] Add more tests for edge cases, hands, promotions, and terminal states

**Expected Outcome:** Comprehensive, maintainable neural network integration tests.

### Phase 5: Test Consolidation and Cleanup (Low Priority, **Mostly Complete**)

**Tasks:**
1. Consolidate duplicated undo move tests:
   - [x] Refactored and consolidated all undo move tests
   - [x] Fixed all linter and import issues
2. Remove or implement commented-out/legacy tests:
   - [x] Moved all legacy/overlapping tests to `tests/deprecated/`
   - [x] Deleted or consolidated redundant tests
3. Implement missing tests for recent enhancements:
   - [ ] Add tests for text formatting, SFEN validation errors, and undo logic state restoration (**future work**)

**Expected Outcome:** Clean, non-redundant, and maintainable test suite.

## Implementation Timeline (Updated, May 2025)

### Week 1: Environment Setup and PyTorch Issue Resolution (**Completed**)
- ✅ Created test utilities and mocks
- ✅ Fixed PyTorch import errors
- ✅ Created example tests demonstrating the mock pattern

### Week 1-2: Core Game Logic Coverage (**Completed**)
- ✅ Converted all tests to use the mock pattern
- ✅ Completed tests for all game state transitions
- ✅ Refactored and consolidated undo move tests
- ✅ Began I/O test refactor

### Week 2-3: I/O and Neural Network Testing (**In Progress**)
- ✅ Refactored and delinted all I/O and observation tests
- [ ] Expand tests for shogi_game_io.py and neural network integration

### Week 3-4: Consolidation, Coverage Expansion, and Final Review (**Upcoming**)
- [ ] Add new tests for coverage expansion, focusing on:
    - Core game logic edge cases (e.g., repetition, checkmate, resignation, draw)
    - Game I/O (text, SFEN, KIF, observation) for realistic and edge-case positions
    - Neural network integration (observation correctness, policy/value output shapes)
    - Error handling and user-facing messages (e.g., SFEN validation, illegal moves)
- [ ] Prioritize tests that:
    - Exercise real game logic, not trivial getters/setters or dead code
    - Cover meaningful branches, error paths, and integration points
    - Avoid requiring changes to production code just for testability
    - Avoid over-testing trivial or implementation-detail code
- [ ] Final cleanup and documentation update
- [ ] Final coverage verification (target: 70%+ for core modules, 75% overall)

## Test Coverage Targets (Updated, May 2025)

| Module                        | Current | Target |
|-------------------------------|---------|--------|
| shogi/__init__.py             | 100%    | 90%    |
| shogi_core_definitions.py     | 67%     | 80%    |
| shogi_game.py                 | 76%     | 70%    |
| shogi_game_io.py              | 80%     | 70%    |
| shogi_rules_logic.py          | 89%     | 80%    |
| shogi_move_execution.py       | 86%     | 80%    |
| ppo_agent.py                  | 84%     | 80%    |
| neural_network.py             | 76%     | 80%    |
| experience_buffer.py          | 75%     | 75%    |
| utils.py                      | 49%     | 60%*   |
| OVERALL                       | ~80%    | 75%    |

*For `utils.py`, only add tests for functions that are used in the main codebase or are critical for user workflows. Do not chase 100% for utility code that is not part of the public API or core logic.

## Next Steps

- Review remaining uncovered lines in `shogi_game.py`, `shogi_game_io.py`, and other core modules.
- Add targeted tests for meaningful, user-facing, or error-handling logic.
- Document any lines intentionally left untested.
- Maintain coverage at or above current levels for all future changes.

## Best Practices for Coverage Expansion

- **Focus on Real-World Scenarios:**
  - Prioritize tests that reflect actual gameplay, user actions, and integration points.
  - Use parametrized tests for common move types, promotions, drops, and endgame scenarios.
  - Cover error handling, edge cases, and user-facing messages (e.g., invalid SFEN, illegal moves, draw conditions).

- **Avoid Meaningless or Trivial Tests:**
  - Do not write tests for trivial getters/setters, one-line wrappers, or code that cannot fail in practice.
  - Do not add tests that require changing production code solely for testability.
  - Focus on code that is part of the public API, user workflows, or critical logic.

- **Maintainability and Clarity:**
  - Use fixtures and the mock utility pattern to keep tests isolated and reliable.
  - Consolidate overlapping tests and remove redundancy.
  - Prefer clear, descriptive test names and docstrings.
  - Keep tests fast and deterministic—avoid randomness or external dependencies.

- **Continuous Review:**
  - Regularly review coverage reports to identify meaningful gaps.
  - Add tests for new features and bug fixes as they are developed.
  - Periodically refactor and clean up the test suite to maintain clarity and focus.

## Conclusion

**The test suite is now a solid foundation for high-quality, maintainable coverage.**
- All linter/import issues are resolved, and the suite is modern and clean.
- The next phase is to expand coverage in a targeted, meaningful way—focusing on real game logic, integration, and user-facing behavior.
- Avoid over-testing or writing tests for code that does not matter to users or maintainers.
- The project is on track for a robust, high-coverage 1.0 release, with a test suite that will remain sustainable as the codebase evolves.
