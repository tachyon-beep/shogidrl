# Evaluation System Plan for Keisei Shogi RL Agent

## Overview
This document tracks the design, implementation, and progress of the evaluation system for the Keisei Shogi RL agent. The goal is to provide robust, testable, and maintainable evaluation of agent checkpoints during and after training, with support for periodic evaluation, logging, and integration with experiment tracking tools (e.g., Weights & Biases).

---

## Goals
- **Modular evaluation logic**: Evaluation should be callable as a function, not just via CLI.
- **Periodic evaluation**: Training should trigger evaluation runs at checkpoint intervals, with results logged and optionally sent to W&B.
- **Testability**: All evaluation logic must be covered by integration and unit tests, following the TEST_POLICY.
- **Maintainability**: No monkey-patching or subprocess hacks; all logic should be direct and explicit.
- **CLI and programmatic support**: Evaluation should be usable both from the command line and as a Python function.

---

## Implementation Plan & Progress

### 1. Refactor evaluation logic to be callable as a function
- **Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- `evaluate.py` now exposes `execute_full_evaluation_run`, which encapsulates all evaluation logic and can be called directly from Python or via the CLI.
- The CLI entrypoint in `evaluate.py` simply parses arguments and calls this function.

### 2. Remove monkey-patch/subprocess evaluation trigger from root `train.py`
- **Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- The root-level `train.py` is now a simple shim that calls `keisei.train.main()`.
- All evaluation triggering logic has been removed from this file.

### 3. Integrate periodic evaluation into main training loop (`keisei/train.py`)
- **Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- After each checkpoint save, the main training loop in `keisei/train.py` calls `execute_full_evaluation_run` directly, passing all relevant config, logging, and W&B parameters.
- Evaluation logs are written to a dedicated subdirectory within the run directory.
- W&B integration is supported for both training and evaluation runs, with correct argument handling.

### 4. Update and expand test suite for new evaluation integration
- **Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- `tests/test_train.py` updated: removed obsolete tests, added integration test to check for periodic evaluation log file creation.
- `tests/test_evaluate.py` updated: covers all evaluation logic, CLI, and W&B integration, using mocks and fixtures as needed.
- All functional and integration tests pass (except for minor lint warnings in test files).

### 5. Update documentation and plans
- **Status:** ✅ **This document updated**
- This plan now reflects the current, completed state of the evaluation system.

---

## Current Architecture (as of 2025-05-23)
- **Evaluation logic**: All in `evaluate.py` as `execute_full_evaluation_run`.
- **Training loop**: Calls evaluation function after checkpoint saves, with full config and logging support.
- **Testing**: All evaluation and integration logic is covered by tests.
- **No monkey-patching or subprocess hacks remain.**

---

## Next Steps / Maintenance
- Monitor for regressions as new features are added.
- Expand evaluation options (e.g., more opponent types, more metrics) as needed.
- Keep test coverage up to date with any changes to evaluation or training logic.
