# Dependencies inherited from requirements.txt that are also used in dev
# (No need to list them again if they are in requirements.txt,
#  but listed here if they are *primarily* dev tools or deeper dependencies of dev tools)
# For example, if 'PyYAML' was only for dev scripts, it would go here.
# Since it's for config loading in the app, it's in requirements.txt.

# Explicitly listing some deeper dependencies of dev tools for clarity or pinning:
astroid==3.3.10         # Pylint's AST anlyzer
dill==0.4.0             # Can be useful for more complex serialization in dev/testing
filelock==3.16.1        # Often used by testing tools or linters for cache management
fsspec==2025.3.2         # May be pulled in by other tools, good to have pinned
iniconfig==2.1.0        # Pytest dependency
mpmath==1.3.0           # Sympy dependency, but if dev tools use sympy features
pathspec==0.12.1        # Black dependency
platformdirs==4.3.8     # Flake8 dependency
pluggy==1.6.0           # Pytest's plugin system
protobuf==6.31.0        # Can be a dependency of various tools, including W&B or Tensorboard
