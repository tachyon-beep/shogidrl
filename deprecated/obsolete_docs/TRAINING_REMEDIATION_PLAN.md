# Training System Remediation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the remediation plan for issues identified in the Keisei Shogi RL training system, based on a recent peer review of `keisei/train.py`, `keisei/utils.py`, and `tests/test_train.py`.

The goal is to address these findings to improve the robustness, maintainability, and effectiveness of the training process.

## 1. Identified Issues & Findings

### 1.1. Issues in `keisei/train.py`
-   **Finding 1.1.1:** Configuration Management Complexity
    -   **Description:** While `--config_file` was added, the script still heavily relies on `omegaconf.DictConfig` defaults and direct attribute setting (e.g., `cfg.env.device = args.device`). This can lead to a scattered configuration definition.
    -   **Impact:** Reduced clarity in configuration, potential for inconsistencies if not all parameters are exposed via CLI or managed centrally in the config file. Harder to track the exact configuration used for a run.
    -   **Severity:** Medium
-   **Finding 1.1.2:** Checkpoint Naming and `total_timesteps`
    -   **Description:** Checkpoints are saved as `checkpoint_ts{cfg.total_timesteps}.pth`. If `total_timesteps` is changed for a resumed run, this could lead to confusing checkpoint filenames. Auto-resume picks the latest, but naming could be more explicit about actual timesteps completed.
    -   **Impact:** Potential confusion in identifying checkpoints, minor risk of data loss if manual intervention leads to incorrect overwrites.
    -   **Severity:** Low to Medium
-   **Finding 1.1.3:** Error Handling for Checkpoint Loading
    -   **Description:** Checkpoint loading has basic `try-except FileNotFoundError`, but could be more robust (e.g., handling corrupted files, version incompatibilities if model structure changes).
    -   **Impact:** Training runs might fail unexpectedly if a checkpoint is subtly corrupted or incompatible.
    -   **Severity:** Medium
-   **Finding 1.1.4:** Usage of Magic Constants/Strings
    -   **Description:** Strings like `"checkpoint_ts*.pth"`, `"effective_config.json"`, `"training_log.json"` are used directly.
    -   **Impact:** Harder to maintain and refactor; typos can lead to silent errors.
    -   **Severity:** Low
-   **Finding 1.1.5:** Logging of Effective Configuration
    -   **Description:** The effective configuration is saved to `effective_config.json`, but not explicitly logged by `TrainingLogger` at the start of the run.
    -   **Impact:** Minor inconvenience for debugging or reviewing run parameters directly from logs.
    -   **Severity:** Low

### 1.2. Issues in `keisei/utils.py` (Loggers)
-   **Finding 1.2.1:** `TrainingLogger` Flexibility
    -   **Description:** `TrainingLogger.log` method has a somewhat fixed structure (`iteration`, `timestep`, `info_dict`).
    -   **Impact:** Might be slightly restrictive if more varied structured logging is needed in the future.
    -   **Severity:** Low
-   **Finding 1.2.2:** `EvaluationLogger` Consistency
    -   **Description:** `EvaluationLogger.log` method was not updated in structure similarly to `TrainingLogger` after `__init__` changes. Tests adapted by passing a more nested `info_dict`.
    -   **Impact:** Potential for inconsistency in how loggers are used or extended; less explicit API.
    -   **Severity:** Low to Medium
-   **Finding 1.2.3:** Shared Kwargs Logic in Logger `__init__`
    -   **Description:** Both loggers accept `**kwargs` in `__init__` passed to `log_to_file`. If their `__init__` needs diverge significantly, this could become less clear.
    -   **Impact:** Minor maintainability concern for the future.
    -   **Severity:** Low

### 1.3. Issues in `tests/test_train.py` (or related to training tests)
-   **Finding 1.3.1:** Test Coverage for Configurations
    -   **Description:** Tests primarily cover default configurations and basic CLI overrides. More extensive testing for various `--config_file` scenarios (e.g., missing file, malformed JSON, overriding specific nested parameters) is needed.
    -   **Impact:** Some configuration pathways might not be fully tested, potentially leading to bugs in production with varied configs.
    -   **Severity:** Medium
-   **Finding 1.3.2:** Checkpoint Resume Test Specificity
    -   **Description:** Existing resume tests are good but could be expanded to cover edge cases like: attempting to resume with a non-existent explicit checkpoint, or resuming when `total_timesteps` in config is less than completed steps in the checkpoint.
    -   **Impact:** Edge cases in resume logic might not be covered, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
    -   **Severity:** Medium
-   **Finding 1.3.3:** Clarity of Test-Specific Configurations
    -   **Description:** Overriding `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL_TIMESTEPS` directly in `cfg` for tests is effective but could be clearer, perhaps by using minimal, test-specific config files.
    -   **Impact:** Test setup might be slightly harder to understand at a glance.
    -   **Severity:** Low

## 2. Proposed Remediation Actions

### 2.1. For Findings in `keisei/train.py`
-   **Action for 1.1.1 (Config Management):**
    -   **Proposal:** Prioritize loading all possible parameters from the `--config_file`. Minimize direct `cfg` modifications post-load. Clearly document the hierarchy (defaults < file < CLI args). Consider a stricter mode where unknown CLI args or config file keys raise errors.
    -   **Priority:** High
    -   **Status:** To Do
-   **Action for 1.1.2 (Checkpoint Naming):**
    -   **Proposal:** Change checkpoint naming to include actual completed timesteps, e.g., `checkpoint_completed_X_target_Y.pth`. Ensure resume logic correctly identifies these.
    -   **Priority:** Medium
    -   **Status:** To Do
-   **Action for 1.1.3 (Checkpoint Error Handling):**
    -   **Proposal:** Add more specific error handling for checkpoint loading, such as checking for file integrity (e.g., simple size check or checksum if feasible) and potentially versioning if model/optimizer states are expected to change significantly.
    -   **Priority:** Medium
    -   **Status:** To Do
-   **Action for 1.1.4 (Magic Constants):**
    -   **Proposal:** Define these strings as constants at the top of the module or in a shared constants file.
    -   **Priority:** Low
    -   **Status:** To Do
-   **Action for 1.1.5 (Log Effective Config):**
    -   **Proposal:** Add a call to `TrainingLogger` at the beginning of `main()` to log the full `effective_config` (perhaps as a pretty-printed JSON string or a structured log entry).
    -   **Priority:** Low
    -   **Status:** To Do

### 2.2. For Findings in `keisei/utils.py`
-   **Action for 1.2.1 (`TrainingLogger` Flexibility):**
    -   **Proposal:** For now, monitor if current flexibility becomes a bottleneck. If more complex structured logging is needed, consider refactoring `log` to accept a more generic dictionary or adopting a more comprehensive logging library/pattern.
    -   **Priority:** Low
    -   **Status:** To Do (Monitor)
-   **Action for 1.2.2 (`EvaluationLogger` Consistency):**
    -   **Proposal:** Refactor `EvaluationLogger.log` to have a signature more consistent with `TrainingLogger.log` (e.g., `log(self, iteration: int, eval_stats: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs: Any)`), or make both more generic if that's the desired direction. Ensure `log_to_file` is appropriately called.
    -   **Priority:** Medium
    -   **Status:** To Do
-   **Action for 1.2.3 (Shared Kwargs):**
    -   **Proposal:** No immediate action. If logger `__init__` methods diverge significantly, consider refactoring shared logic into a base class or helper function.
    -   **Priority:** Low
    -   **Status:** To Do (Monitor)

### 2.3. For Findings in `tests/test_train.py`
-   **Action for 1.3.1 (Config Test Coverage):**
    -   **Proposal:** Add new test cases for:
        -   Loading a valid config file with overrides.
        -   Behavior with a missing `--config_file`.
        -   Behavior with a malformed JSON in `--config_file`.
        -   Interaction of CLI args and config file (CLI should win).
    -   **Priority:** Medium
    -   **Status:** To Do
-   **Action for 1.3.2 (Resume Test Specificity):**
    -   **Proposal:** Add test cases for:
        -   `train.py --resume_checkpoint /path/to/nonexistent.pth`
        -   Scenario where `cfg.total_timesteps` is less than timesteps in the checkpoint being resumed.
        -   Resuming with a potentially corrupted (e.g., empty) checkpoint file.
    -   **Priority:** Medium
    -   **Status:** To Do
-   **Action for 1.3.3 (Clarity of Test Configs):**
    -   **Proposal:** For tests requiring significant config deviation, create minimal JSON config files in `tests/fixtures` (or similar) and load them using `--config_file` in the test setup. This makes the test's base configuration explicit.
    -   **Priority:** Low
    -   **Status:** To Do
