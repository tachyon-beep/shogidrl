## Current State Analysis

### Existing Evaluation Limitations

The current evaluation system in `/keisei/evaluation/` has significant bottlenecks:

1. **Sequential Game Execution**
   - Games run one at a time in `run_evaluation_loop()`
   - Typical evaluation: 100 games × 2-3 minutes per game = 3-5 hours
   - CPU cores remain underutilized during evaluation

2. **Single Opponent Testing**
   - Only one opponent type tested per evaluation run
   - Multiple opponent comparisons require sequential runs
   - No concurrent baseline testing

3. **Research Iteration Delays**
   - Long evaluation cycles slow down model development
   - Researchers wait hours for performance feedback
   - Limited experimental throughput

4. **Resource Inefficiency**
   - Modern systems have 8-32 CPU cores
   - Current system uses only 1 core for evaluation
   - GPU remains idle during CPU-bound game simulation

### Existing Infrastructure Assets

The project already has robust parallel training infrastructure:

✅ **Parallel Training System (95% Complete)**
- `ParallelManager` - Multi-process coordination
- `SelfPlayWorker` - Independent game execution
- `WorkerCommunicator` - Queue-based communication
- `ModelSynchronizer` - Efficient model distribution
- Comprehensive testing framework

This infrastructure provides a proven foundation for parallel evaluation implementation.
